- ğŸ¦‰ Currently learning Blue Team security analysis and network/system hardening.
- ğŸ“œ Recently completed the CompTIA Security+.
- ğŸš€ Originally worked in an IT analysis and development role, but have been playing CTFs for several years and recently began taking steps to fully pivot into cybersecurity, my first love.
